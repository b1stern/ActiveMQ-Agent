# ActiveMQ-Agent
This is an IBM APM Monitoring Agent to monitor ActiveMQ

Description:  
This package includes a monitoring agent to monitor ActiveMQ using IBM Cloud Application Performance Management.  It was developed and tested with Active MQ versions 5.14 and 5.15, but should work with other versions of ActiveMQ.  JMX must be enabled on the ActiveMQ server.  By default, JMX is disabled in an ActiveMQ deployment.

The agent provides monitoring of ActiveMQ via JMX.  The monitoring agent provides detailed monitoring of the broker, queues, topics, memory pool, and more.   The agent provides the ability to monitor the Dead Letter Queue.

The Agent can be configured to monitor one or more ActiveMQ systems.  ActiveMQ can be monitored locally or remotely via JMX
